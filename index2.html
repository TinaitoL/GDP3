                    Artemis is the Olympian goddess of the hunt, the moon, and chastity. In time, she also became associated with childbirth and nature. Artemis is almost universazlly depicted as a young, beautiful and vigorous huntress carrying a quiver with arrows and holding a bow, typically wearing a short knee-high tunic and often accompanied by some animal (stag, doe, or hunting dogs).
                    </p>
                    <p class="p22">As a moon goddess, she is sometimes represented wearing a long robe and a crescent moon crown. Like all the Greek Olympic gods, Artemis was immortal and very powerful. Her special powers included perfect aim with the bow and arrow, the ability to turn herself and others into animals, healing, disease, and control of nature.She was the daughter of Zeus, king of the gods, and the Titaness Leto and she has a twin brother, the god Apollo. She was worshipped across the Greek world, but her most famous cult site was as a fertility goddess at the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. To the Romans, the goddess was known as Diana.

                    Plato says that the name “Artemis” is related to her virginity and the Ancient Greek word for “unharmed” or “pure,” However, scholars can’t agree over its original meaning. Meaning unknown, possibly related either to Greek αρτεμης (artemes) meaning “safe” or αρταμος (artamos) meaning “a butcher”. Nowadays, her name also has the meaning of “Whole” and “Healthy” In the Nordic region.

                    <p class="p32">

                    Artemis was the protectors of virtue, and still are relevant. Artemis has a NASA space mission named after her, the ARTEMIS mission studies the moon's interaction with the sun. Today, Artemis is still a great example of feminists and advocates of women. It demonstrated that women could still exist without men in their lives to make them happy.  Artemis still inspire women and businesses today. In Modern Day Novels, Films, girls, and women with indomitable spirit are the protagonists in many of the most-read novels and fictional series. They have emerged in the creative process of authors. For example, there are parallels with Katniss in The Hunger Games and Greek goddess Artemis. Artemis represents strength, accuracy, nurturing, and protection. As in The Hunger Games, research is often about trying to make sense of a challenging environment. The strength of focus and accuracy in interpretation is critical. Both are strong, independent female characters, and both are archers. Both Katniss and Artemis were skilled hunters, and not much interested in the opposite sex. Those are the obvious similarities.
